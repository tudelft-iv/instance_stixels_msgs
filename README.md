This repository only contains the [ROS](https://www.ros.org) message
definitions for Instance Stixels.
It is separated from the main code which is located
[here](https://github.com/tudelft-iv/instance_stixels),
such that the messages may be used (e.g. from a ROS bag) without installing the
entire pipeline.
